# INSTAGRAM-CLONE-DATABASE-MYSQL
My recent project where I designed and implemented a relational database for an Instagram clone using MySQL. This endeavor provided hands-on experience in database design, normalization, and crafting complex SQL queries. 

üîç Project Highlights:

 ‚Ä¢ Structured tables for users, photos, likes, comments, followers, and hashtags.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Established clear relationships using primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.
 
 ‚Ä¢ Executed queries to extract insights, such as identifying top contributors and analyzing user engagement patterns. 

üìä Analytical queries to derive insights like:

‚Ä¢     Most active users

‚Ä¢     Top trending tags

‚Ä¢     Users who haven't posted

‚Ä¢     Most liked photo

‚Ä¢     Sign-up trends by day

‚Ä¢     Users who liked all photos


This project not only enhanced my SQL proficiency but also deepened my understanding of backend data management for social media platforms.
